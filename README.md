My name is Scott Screen, I'm a cool App designed by Thiago Cruz, a.k.a. Dad, to help him get an awesome job at Incuca!
Make yourself at home, try some clicks around and I hope you will have fun!

## How to play with Scott Screen

It's very easy to play around with Scott, you just need a couple clicks and to wait some (awesome) dialogs!

- At the first screen Scott will appear and intruduce itsel... I mean, himself.
- Be polite and answer him!
- After that he will wait you to click on the screen, patiently.
- Scott's mood is very mutable, so he will get sad very easily...
- All you need to do is click again, once he finishes his sad monolog.
- Jokes will be told; moods will be restored; the sun will shine again...
- One last click and will get back to the start!

Have fun playing with Scott!
